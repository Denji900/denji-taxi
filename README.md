Denji's Taxi Job
---------------

This is a pretty straightforward job script for QBCore that lets your players pick up passengers, drive them around, and get paid.

The fun part is the dialogue systemâ€”clients will ask you questions during the trip, and how you answer affects your rating and your final tip.

---------------
Features
---------------

- Go On Duty: Start your shift at an NPC and get a taxi provided.
- Random Fares: Get calls for pickups and drop-offs all over the map.
- Interactive Dialogue: Clients will talk to you and ask questions with voice lines.
- 5-Star Rating System: Start with a 3-star rating. Answering questions nicely can raise it, while being rude will lower it.
- Tip System: A higher star rating at the end of a fare means a bigger tip!
- Customizable: Almost everything can be easily changed in the `config.lua`.

---------------
Dependencies
---------------

This script was built to work with these resources. Make sure you have them started.

- `qb-core`
- `ox_lib`
- `ox_target`
(Recommended) - `Renewed-Banking` (can be swapped for another banking script with a quick change in `server/sv_main.lua`)
- A key script like `qb-vehiclekeys`

---------------
Installation
---------------

1. Drag the `denji-taxi` folder into your `resources` directory.
2. Add `ensure denji-taxi` to your `server.cfg` file. Make sure you start it *after* all of the dependencies listed above.
3. Restart your server. You're good to go!

---------------
Audio Setup
---------------

This script uses voice lines for the dialogue system. You can change audio files to match your language.

1. Place your `.ogg` audio files in the `html/audio/` folder.
2. The script finds voice lines based on the passenger's gender. The naming is important:

   - `filename_male.ogg`
   - `filename_female.ogg`

For example, in `config.lua`, if you have a dialogue entry with `audio = "q_busy_day"`, the script will look for `q_busy_day_male.ogg` and `q_busy_day_female.ogg`.

---------------
Configuration
---------------

You can change most things in the `config.lua` file.

**Passenger Models**

You need to tell the script which character models to use for male and female passengers. This is how it knows which voice line folder to use.

Config.MalePassengerModels = { 's_m_y_passenger_01', 's_m_y_tourist_01', 'a_m_y_hipster_01', 'a_m_y_business_01' }
Config.FemalePassengerModels = { 's_f_y_tourist_01', 'a_f_y_tourist_01', 'a_f_y_hipster_01', 'a_f_y_business_02' }

**Dialogue & Rating**

This is where you write the conversations.

- `question` is what the NPC says.
- `audio` is the filename for the voice line (without `_male.ogg` or `_female.ogg`).
- `answers` is a list of up to 3 responses for the player.
- Add `good = true` to an answer to make it increase the player's rating.
- Add `bad = true` to an answer to make it lower the player's rating.

Config.Dialogue = {
    {
        question = "So, busy day for you?",
        audio = "q_busy_day",
        answers = {
            { text = "Just the way I like it.", good = true },
            { text = "It's alright." },
            { text = "Can we just drive?", bad = true },
        }
    },
    -- ... more questions here ...
}

**Keybinds**

The default keys are `J` to accept a fare, and `U`, `I`, `O` for dialogue answers. Your players can change these in their `FiveM Settings > Key Bindings > Denji's Taxi Job` menu.
